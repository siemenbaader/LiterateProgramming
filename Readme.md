Edit your thoughts in markdown in the &lt;source&gt; tags. 

Edit the example code in &lt;code&gt; sections. Reload the browser and watch the unit test go green or red. 

Edit the inspection library in the &lt;coffee-script&gt; tag.

*Note:* To see the unit test running, try to scroll down to one and refresh the browser.

That's it!
